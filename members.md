## Principal Investigator/Faculty
- **Prof. Visenya Targaryen** — email@university.edu
  Like her siblings, Visenya possessed the classical Valyrian features: long, silver-gold hair,which she often braided or bound up in rings, and purple eyes. A voluptuous andsensual woman, hers was a harsher, more austere beauty than her sister, Rhaenys. Their personalities were also much dissimilar, for Visenya was passionate and dark toRhaenys'playful and mischevious. Even those who loved her best considered Visenyastern, serious, and unforgiving. Some claimed that Visenya dabbled in dark sorceries andplayed with poisons.
